<h4>about</h4>

<p class="about">This is the blog of the 
<a href="http://faircloth-lab.org/">faircloth-lab</a>, a
scientific workgroup interested in evolutionary biology; phylogenomics;
comparative genomics; and the relationships between genetic diversity, 
phenotypic variation, and environmental differences.  We dig working with
different critters and using the unique traits of each to help answer
our questions.</p>

<p class="tiny">The theme we use here is derived from one created by
<a href="https://github.com/studiomohawk">Yuya Saito</a>, and the blog
is powered by the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">jekyll</a> 
templating engine.</p>
